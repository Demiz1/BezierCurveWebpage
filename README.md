# BezierCurveWebpage
This is a webpage that creates a bezier-curve and visualizes it in a html-canvas.

The js implements the bezier-curve from scratch, but not verry optimized when there's a lot of points.

Maybe I get around to write some explaining sections on the webpage that teaches how the bezier curve
works in a nice way.


Currently the webpage is hosted [here](https://gate-garden.com/BezierCurve)
